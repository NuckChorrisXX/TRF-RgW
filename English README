# TRF-RgW – Open Energy Reactor

**Thermochemical Reactor with Solid Oxide Reduction and Coupled Thermal Feedback**

---

### 🧪 What is it?

TRF-RgW is a fully solid-state, closed reactor for self-sufficient energy generation.

It uses a controlled redox reaction between **magnesium hydride (MgH₂)** and **copper(II) oxide (CuO)** to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity via **thermoelectric generators (TEGs)**.

- No pressure, no moving parts  
- Only **hydrogen and oxygen** as energy media  
- Includes waste heat utilization & steam output  
- Just heat, no flame – no ignition required

📦 **Modular Extension:**
- [SOEC Module – High-Temperature Electrolysis (Details)](./SOEC.md)
