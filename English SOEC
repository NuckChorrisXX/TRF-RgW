### 🔬 Extension: High-Temperature Electrolysis Module (SOEC)

The TRF-RgW system can optionally be expanded with a high-temperature electrolysis unit based on SOEC technology (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell). This add-on module enables the electrochemical splitting of steam or CO₂ at temperatures between 600 °C and 850 °C – ideally matched to the existing process heat from the MgH₂ reactor core.

#### Advantages of the SOEC approach in the TRF-RgW context:

- ✅ Utilizes available waste heat to activate electrolysis (thermally recirculated)
- ✅ Produces pure H₂ or O₂ without moving parts (fully compatible with solid-state design)
- ✅ Supplementary hydrogen production for reactor recharging or storage
- ✅ Enables a closed oxygen cycle within the internal CuO module

#### Possible use cases:

- 🔄 Hydrogen recovery during surplus operation (for intermediate storage in the MgH₂ module)
- ♻️ Regeneration of CuO-based oxygen capture via targeted O₂ extraction
- 🔌 Powered by locally generated electricity (e.g., from thermoelectric generators) → enables fully autonomous operation

#### Technical notes:

- The SOEC module is based on ceramic electrolytes (e.g., YSZ) with nickel and lanthanum electrodes.
- Integration requires only minimal structural additions – e.g., a heated chamber with steam inlet and power connection.
- With proper layout, heat losses from the reactor can simultaneously drive the SOEC system.

> ⚠️ Note: This add-on module is optional and currently in the experimental phase. Thermal coupling is passive via the reactor’s heat distribution – no active heating elements are required.
